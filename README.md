# Zika_Data2LinkedData
This reopository contains a python script that converts tabular data on observed Zika cases in the americas. The data is converted to RDF using the Wikidata namespace. 
Having the data being described in the Wikidata namespaces allows rapid integration with data from Wikidata

### Disclaimer
The script is for demonstration purposes only. The different data values 
are mapped to the Wikidata namespace using freetext search.
